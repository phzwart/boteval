    "question": "Hi Phenixbb, We would appreciate your advice regarding an odd problem that has cropped up with one of our crystal structures. We have a protein structure in space group P6(3)22 at 2.1 A resolution and in the final refinement stages with Rwork of 0.20 and Rfree of 0.22. When we ran simulated annealing to rebuild an outlier Lysine residue in a loop, the Sim Omit map showed the positive density expected from the omission of the loop (contour level 3 sigma, colored green in attached pics). However, flanking the positive density, there is a complimentary negative density (in red). We are puzzled as to the cause of the appearance of the negative density. Can you help us?"

    "question": "Dear all, I have highly anisotropic data. I was able to solve the structure by MR, and refine it with phenix.refine to Rwork/Rfree=0.28/0.31 with Resolution cutoff 2.64\u00c5 and mean B values 114, which is pretty high for such resolution. Though the overall structure makes sense, the maps are quite featureless, no water molecules, and side-chains refinement is a problem. I have tested how the data is anisotropic with Diffraction Anisotropy Server which shows clearly, that we don't really have data to 2.64\u00c5 in all directions. I would like to know if it's possible to use Phenix with some more advance parameters to actually address the issue of anisotropy and to get maximum out of the data."

What are the CaBLAM score, the Ca geometry score, the helix score and the 3-10 score? How to use the information under the secondary structure tab? In my protein for example, I see a lot of 'try beta sheets', should I try to refine that segment using beta sheets restraints?"

I set the resolution to 7.52 A but didn't supply a resolution for density modification - it seems to have chosen a value of 5.671 A. It states 'Estimated improvement of -0.450 A to d_min(FSCref=0.5): 6.628 A' suggesting to me that it agrees with the postprocessed resolution. What resolution should I supply to RSR if I use the density modified map?"

Also, I have the pdb of the asymmetric unit and I am trying to fit it into my cryo-EM map of the whole structure (which has octahedral symmetry).

    "question": "General strategies: I select COOT for the model building; using phenix.real_sapce_refine for the real space refinement with secondary structure restrain and REFMAC for the reciprocal space refinement. Few questions are listed here: 1. The map was too bigger to open it in COOT. The phenix.map_to_structure_factors was used to obtaine ~120 MB sized MTZ file (still a little big for my computer). I manually build up the whole ball-shaped phage with the rigid body fit in COOT (from two X-ray structures to 120 chains). In this case, should I crop the map in Chimera or other software and only focus on a small asymmetric unit to do the model building?"

    "question": "I collected two datasets of the same ligand bound structure at 2.4 and 2.1 \u00c5 resolution. The apo structure has already been solved to 2.2\u00c5 resolution in P31 (and P3121 for SeMet). After processing each dataset as both P31 and P3121 in MOSFLM, I proceeded with MR with Phaser using sequential partial search models to place either 3 copies in the ASU for P3121, or 6 copies for P31. My concern is that there is some pathology that is not being recognized (merohedral twinning) or that the NCS/pseudosymmetry is not being addressed appropriately. The R/Rfree values are hung up at ~0.42/0.46."

I have provided the model I edited after AutoSol, my HA sites, and the data, and I got a better map than even just with AutoSol!!!

If I do MR with phaser-MR a solution is found easily. If I then continue with MR-SAD the program does not give me a solution. No file named overall_best.pdb is present in the output directory. Warnings: FOM < 0.05 ... skipping solution 1. However Autosol with extreme density modification and Iterate substructure search is able to solve the structure. Will the MTZ file (phases) produced from MR-SAD always be better (compared to SAD or MR alone) because it will contain phases that combine the information from both the MR model and the SAD data?"

Phaser calculated the eLLG to be about 5, and maybe not surprisingly, it failed even after using Sculptor to prepare the model. It also says that solutions with Z-scores more than 8 were rejected for failing the packing test. Solvent content calculation from Xtriage suggests about 8 copies in the asu. Would this be of any help in MR?"

So in your case the best thing is to run phenix.refine with your original mtz file. You can create a freeR set in the GUI. My problem is that when I try to define the 11 remaining sites for the 'refine anomalous groups' selection the software complains: Invalid combination: F-obs not anomalous, but refinement of 11 f_double_prime values requested."

This is part of some wider work to adapt Phaser's algorithms for real space molecular replacement to work better in the cryo-EM docking problem. So far, the magnification factor refinement seems to be pretty robust in our tests. Is there a method to refine the pixel size of an image reconstruction if the PDB has been docked in?"

The ligand binding site contains a Calcium ion. In the apo form there are 2 waters coordinating this Calcium. In the ligand bound form, these waters are replaced by oxygen atoms within the ligand. However, the ligand is only at 0.5 Occupancy as part of the ligand lies on a crystallographic two-fold axis. So I added 2 0.5 occupancy waters to the model at these positions."

I add the ligand using Coot and it fit perfectly into the electron density map. I then tried to run phenix.refine by giving the protein structure pdb file, the original mtz file and the protein sequence fasta file. However, there was an error message saying missing restraints for the ligand. So I generate the CIF file for the ligand using the Ready Set icon in the toolbar. The ligand CIF file and a updated protein structure pdb file was generated and automatically added to the refinement windows. However, when I run the refinement, I saw this error message: Number of nonbonded interaction distances <0.001:2. Please inspect the output above (or in the log window) and correct the input model file. When I inspect the log window, the error is due to the oxygen atoms in the ligand being too close to each other. Why is there an error if the ligand was generated automatically in Phenix?"

I am getting better statistics (Rfactor/Rfree) as compared to REFMAC so having strong inclination to continue with PHENIX but there are some discripancies I found when comparing with CCP4 programs. When going for AutoBuild afterwards it uses output pdb (MR.1.pdb) which is fine but uses MR.1.mtz as map coefficient. Shouldnot it uses original mtz from scala? Same in Phenix.refine when going after Autobuild finishes and it asks for refining the model it uses same AutoMR output mtz (MR.1.mtz). As I was suggested by many that we should use original mtz coming from scala for Refinement to reduce model bias."
